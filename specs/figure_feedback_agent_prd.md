# Product Requirements Document: BioRender Figure Feedback Agent

## Executive Summary
Build an AI-powered feedback system for BioRender that helps life science researchers create clearer, more visually appealing, and scientifically accurate figures by providing instant, actionable recommendations on their scientific illustrations, pathway diagrams, and experimental workflows.

## Problem Statement
Life science researchers using BioRender are domain experts but lack visual design training. They spend significant time creating figures that may be scientifically accurate but fail to communicate effectively due to poor visual hierarchy, color usage, layout, or information architecture. This results in rejected publications, confused audiences, and research impact limitations.

## Solution Overview

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Image Analysis Complexity**: Computer vision for scientific figures more challenging than natural images
- **Scientific Domain Breadth**: Accuracy validation across diverse life science fields
- **JSON Structure Evolution**: BioRender data format changes could break parsing
- **Implementation Complexity**: Converting high-level recommendations into precise JSON modifications
- **Preview Generation**: Rendering accurate before/after images from JSON modifications
- **Edge Case Handling**: Automated changes may break figure integrity in complex layouts

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with well-defined figure types (pathways) before expanding scope
- Leverage LLM general scientific knowledge rather than specific databases initially
- Build flexible JSON parsing with graceful degradation for unknown structures
- Implement extensive user feedback collection for continuous improvement
- Begin automated implementation with simple changes (colors, text sizes) before complex layout modifications
- Include comprehensive validation checks before applying any JSON modifications
- Provide granular undo/redo functionality for all automated changes
- Test implementation accuracy extensively with diverse figure samples

## Success Criteria
- **Phase 1 Success**: 10 researchers successfully receive actionable feedback on diverse figure types
- **Phase 3 Success**: 100 researchers actively using integrated tool with 4.0+ satisfaction ratings  
- **Phase 4 Success**: 80% of users accept at least 2 proposed automated changes per figure
- **Scale Success**: Handle 1000+ figure analyses per month with implementation generation in <20 seconds total

## Future Roadmap
- **Real-Time Guidance**: Live suggestions during figure creation in BioRender editor with instant auto-apply
- **Advanced Automation**: Complex layout restructuring and content reorganization
- **Style Learning**: Personalized recommendations and automated styling based on user's discipline preferences
- **Collaborative Review**: Multi-reviewer feedback aggregation with consensus-based auto-implementation
- **Template Suggestions**: AI-generated figure templates with auto-population based on research abstracts
- **Intelligent Assistance**: Proactive suggestions for incomplete figures ("What should I add next?")
